## 1. Pass Networks

Pass Networks are a useful way for finding out the average positions of players per game and the frequency of passes played between them.

I have calculated the average position (mean of all the points on the pitch where they passed/tackled/intercepted or shot the ball) of each player individually.
Then took a note of all the passes played by the team and assigned a passer and reciever.
Used this to calculate the frequency of the receivers and passers thus giving us a list of the highest to lowest passsing combitions.

All that is left is to plot out the passes with respect to the average positions. I have altered line and node width based on the frequency of the pass and involvment of the player in the game.

## 2. Shot Location Data

Shot location data prints the shots, shots on target and goals scored by the home and away side in a game.
